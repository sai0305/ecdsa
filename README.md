# ecdsa
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design and develop a VHDL model to generate and verify a digital signature of a message using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature algorithm and verify its functionality using the simulation and synthesis results obtained and implement it on FPGA.
Abstract:
In recent years elliptic curve cryptography has attracted the attention because of its mathematical structure and high security in comparision to other algorithms The digital signature system based on elliptic curve (ECDSA) is one of the main stream digital signature systems.ECDSA rely on the a private key in theauthenticator and a public key that host uses to verify the authenticator.
In open systems where the third party needs to be authenticated the management and protection of secret keys can be problem,here is where ECDSA offers required flexibility.
